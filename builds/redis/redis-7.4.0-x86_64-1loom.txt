redis: Redis (Key-Value Store)
redis:
redis: Redis is an advanced key-value store.  It is similar to memcached but
redis: the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like
redis: in memcached, but also lists, sets, and ordered sets.  These data
redis: types can be manipulated with atomic operations to push/pop elements,
redis: add/remove elements, perform server side union, intersection,
redis: Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or a fixed-length array.
