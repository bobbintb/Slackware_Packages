PACKAGE NAME:  bcc-0.33.0-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz
PACKAGE LOCATION:  ./bcc
PACKAGE SIZE (compressed):  39024 K
PACKAGE SIZE (uncompressed):  114260 K
PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
bcc: bcc (BPF Compiler Collection)
bcc:
bcc: BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and
bcc: manipulation programs, and includes several useful tools and
bcc: examples. It makes use of extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filters),
bcc: formally known as eBPF, a new feature that was first added to Linux
bcc: 3.15. Much of what BCC uses requires Linux 4.1 and above.

PACKAGE NAME:  bpftrace-0.22.1-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz
PACKAGE LOCATION:  ./bpftrace
PACKAGE SIZE (compressed):  3524 K
PACKAGE SIZE (uncompressed):  9120 K
PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
bpftrace: bpftrace (bpftrace is a high-level tracing language for Linux BPF)
bpftrace:
bpftrace: bpftrace is a high-level tracing language for Linux enhanced
bpftrace: Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) available in recent Linux kernels.
bpftrace: bpftrace uses LLVM as a backend to compile scripts to BPF-bytecode
bpftrace: and makes use of BCC for interacting with the Linux BPF system, as
bpftrace: well as existing Linux tracing capabilities: kernel dynamic tracing
bpftrace: (kprobes), user-level dynamic tracing (uprobes), and tracepoints.
bpftrace: The bpftrace language is inspired by awk and C, and predecessor
bpftrace: tracers such as DTrace and SystemTap.

PACKAGE NAME:  ply-2.3.0-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz
PACKAGE LOCATION:  ./ply
PACKAGE SIZE (compressed):  3564 K
PACKAGE SIZE (uncompressed):  10770 K
PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
ply: ply (A light-weight dynamic tracer for Linux that leverages eBPF.)
ply:
ply: A light-weight dynamic tracer for Linux that leverages the
ply: kernel's BPF VM in concert with kprobes and tracepoints to
ply: attach probes to arbitrary points in the kernel. Most tracers that
ply: generate BPF bytecode are based on the LLVM based BCC toolchain. ply
ply: on the other hand has no required external dependencies except
ply: for libc.

PACKAGE NAME:  redis-7.4.0-x86_64-1loom.txz
PACKAGE LOCATION:  ./redis
PACKAGE SIZE (compressed):  1308 K
PACKAGE SIZE (uncompressed):  5130 K
PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
redis: Redis (Key-Value Store)
redis:
redis: Redis is an advanced key-value store.  It is similar to memcached but
redis: the dataset is not volatile, and values can be strings, exactly like
redis: in memcached, but also lists, sets, and ordered sets.  These data
redis: types can be manipulated with atomic operations to push/pop elements,
redis: add/remove elements, perform server side union, intersection,
redis: Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or a fixed-length array.
redis: Redis supports different kinds of sorting abilities.

PACKAGE NAME:  redisearch-2.10.12-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz
PACKAGE LOCATION:  ./redisearch
PACKAGE SIZE (compressed):  8 K
PACKAGE SIZE (uncompressed):  20 K
PACKAGE DESCRIPTION:
redisearch: redisearch (Querying, secondary indexing, and full-text search for Redis)
redisearch:
redisearch: RediSearch is a Redis module that provides querying, secondary
redisearch: indexing, and full-text search for Redis. To use RediSearch, you
redisearch: first declare indexes on your Redis data. You can then use the
redisearch: RediSearch query language to query that data.
