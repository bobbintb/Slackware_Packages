ply: ply (Light-weight dynamic tracer for Linux)
ply:
ply: A light-weight dynamic tracer for Linux that leverages the kernel's
ply: BPF VM in concert with kprobes and tracepoints to attach probes to
ply: arbitrary points in the kernel.
ply: ply follows the Little Language approach of yore, compiling ply
ply: scripts into Linux BPF programs that are attached to kprobes and
ply: tracepoints in the kernel.
