ply: A light-weight dynamic tracer for Linux that leverages the
ply: kernel's BPF VM in concert with kprobes and tracepoints to
ply: attach probes to arbitrary points in the kernel. Most tracers that
ply: generate BPF bytecode are based on the LLVM based BCC toolchain. ply
ply: on the other hand has no required external dependencies except
ply: for libc.
