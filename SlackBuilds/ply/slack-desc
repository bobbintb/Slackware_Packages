# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

ply: A light-weight dynamic tracer for Linux that leverages the
ply: kernel's BPF VM in concert with kprobes and tracepoints to
ply: attach probes to arbitrary points in the kernel. Most tracers that
ply: generate BPF bytecode are based on the LLVM based BCC toolchain. ply
ply: on the other hand has no required external dependencies except
ply: for libc.
