# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

fsprobe:
fsprobe: FSProbe is a file system events notifier based on eBPF. Instead of
fsprobe: hooking at the syscall level (like other eBPF solutions: opensnoop,
fsprobe: Falco, ...), FSProbe works by listening for events at the VFS
fsprobe: level. Paths are resolved at runtime by going through the dentry tree
fsprobe: up to the mount point of the filesystem. One of the main advantages
fsprobe: of this solution is that the paths provided by FSProbe are absolute
fsprobe: and resolved, while a syscall based strategy would only export
fsprobe: syscall parameters (and thus potentially attacker controlled data).
