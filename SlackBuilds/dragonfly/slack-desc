# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

dragonflydb:
dragonflydb: Dragonfly is an in-memory data store built for modern application
dragonflydb: workloads.  Fully compatible with Redis and Memcached APIs, Dragonfly
dragonflydb: requires no code changes to adopt. Compared to legacy in-memory
dragonflydb: datastores, Dragonfly delivers 25X more throughput, higher cache
dragonflydb: hit rates with lower tail latency, and can run on up to 80% less
dragonflydb: resources for the same sized workload.
